        <h3 id="headline">Interesting facts about bananas</h3>
        <li><strong>Size</strong> - Bananas come in a variety of sizes and the rind can be green, yellow, red, purple or brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Domestication</strong> - Most likely domesticated in Papua New Guinea, the banana is now grown in 135 countries as food, fiber, 
                    banana wine and banana beer. Evidence shows that farmers may have started cultivating the banana as far back as 8000 BCE</li>
        <li><strong>It does not grow on a tree</strong> - It is actually a herbaceous flowering plant with an average height of 15 feet.</li>
        <li><strong>Radioactive</strong> - Because of their potassium content, bananas are slightly radioactive.</li>
        <li><strong>Banana vs Plantains</strong> - In Europe and the Americas the banana is split into 2 families, the classic yellow sweet banana, 
                    and the plantains. Which are more starchy and less sweet, typically being cooked before consuming. Note: In Asia the distinction
                    between bananas and plantains is not as clear, with both simply considered bananas and eaten raw and cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Seeds</strong> - In wild varieties, bananas have large hard seeds. Farmers have cultivated the banana to a point that the
                    seeds no longer grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-seasonal</strong> - In warm weather bananas will grown year round, allowing us to eat fresh bananas any time of year.</li>
        <li><strong>Disease</strong> - Because a majority of bananas are from the Cavendish group, there are fears that disease could potentially
                    make growing difficult. Something similar happened to the Gros Michel group where panama disease made them unviable for large
                    scale production. Tropical Race 4(TR4) is a strain of panama disease that is infecting the Cavendish group. Because all the
                    plants are genetically identical they cannot evolve resistance. Researchers are searching other varieties for replacement and 
                    scientists are attempting to make the Cavendish group genetically resistant to disease. </li>
        <li><strong>Gas</strong> - Bananas are picked green and exposed to ethylene gas to induce the ripening process. If they are not exposed to
                    the gas they will not fully ripen before they begin to rot. Bananas that have not been gassed are usually eaten cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage and Transport</strong> - Because the banana is grow in tropical areas, it needs to be kept cool to prevent the
                    ripening process and moved fast before they rot. They naturally produce ethylene to ripen, which is why they are exposed to
                    ethylene gas before hitting the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Potassium</strong> - The banana is know for it's potassium content but there are several other vegetables with higher
                    levels of the mineral including spinach, potatoes, soybeans, portabella mushrooms, and processed tomato sauces.
                    Plantains have a higher potassium content then the banana.</li>
      </ul>
